Built a logisitc regression model to estimate poverty using aggregate household characteristics in various districts

This study aims to analyse the multi-dimensional nature of poverty in rural India and to 
assess the impact of various household and population characteristics in order to determine 
the likelihood of poverty in rural areas of each district , we build a logistic regression model 
for this purpose using data from district level household and facility survey (DLHS) in order 
to provide insights about different non-income characteristics which could play a vital role to 
ensure poverty reduction in rural areas.
